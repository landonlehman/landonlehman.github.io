---

I am a graduate student in theoretical physics at the Unversity of Notre Dame,
advised by Adam Martin. I have a bachelor's degree in physics along with a minor
in math from Purdue University. My research is currently focused on operators in
the Standard Model effective field theory. I have also worked on LHC
phenomenology, along with a bit of cosmology. See my cv for a complete list of
my publications.
