I am a graduate student in theoretical physics at the University of Notre Dame,
advised by Adam Martin. I have a bachelor's degree in physics along with a minor
in math from Purdue University. My research is currently focused on operators in
the Standard Model effective field theory. I have also worked on LHC
phenomenology, along with a bit of cosmology. See [my cv](lehman_cv.pdf) for a complete list of
my publications.

### Interests

#### Reading good books

Some of my perenially favorite fiction writers are [Neal
Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com/ ), [Peter
Watts](http://www.rifters.com/ ), [Dan
Simmons](http://www.dansimmons.com/index.html ), and [William
Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/ ). I have also recently enjoyed Liu
Cixin and [Pierce Brown](http://www.pierce-brown.com/).

I am currently reading *The Invention of Science: A New History of the
Scientific Revolution* by David Wootton.

#### Working out

Currently at [Crossfit South Bend](http://crossfitsouthbend.com/). Constantly
chasing better movement patterns.

#### Listening to good music

[Arvo Part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvo_P%C3%A4rt) has been in heavy
rotation recently.
