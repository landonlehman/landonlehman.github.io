title: Derivatives of the Dirac Delta
---

I've been thinking lately about derivatives of the Dirac delta function. In
particular, how to obtain formulas like

$$ \delta'(f(x)) = \text{sign}(f') \left[ \frac{1}{f^{'2}} \delta'(x-x_i) +
	\frac{f''}{f^{'3}} \delta(x-x_i) \right] $$

and similar, more complicated expressions for higher derivatives. In the above
formula, the function $$f(x)$$ is assumed to have a single zero at $$x = x_i$$,
and all of the derivatives on the right-hand side are evaluated at $$x_i$$. If
$$f(x)$$ would have multiple zeroes, the right-hand side would include a sum
over all the zeroes.

Deriving these formulas isn't that hard, but I've been trying to come up with
some nice applications; perhaps they might be useful in the electrodynamics of
infinite *curves*, rather than straight *lines* of charge. You can also use them
to evaluate integrals such as

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta''(\cos{x})\; e^{-x^2} \text{d}x . $$
